## Project Idea

**Portal Panic** is a small-scale **3D VR game** developed with **Unity**.  
The artistic direction follows a **low-poly** style.  

- The player fights against enemies emerging from portals scattered across the map.  
- The setting is a **manor garden** at night.  
- **Goal:** survive as many waves of enemies as possible.

## Gameplay Mechanics

**Weapons (3 types):**
1. **Sword** – close combat weapon.  
2. **Ranged weapon** – can be upgraded during the game.  
3. **Bomb** – powerful area attack, regenerates every 3 minutes.  

**Enemy Waves:**
- Enemies move towards the player and attack.  
- Each new wave increases enemy count.  
- Enemy portals are chosen randomly per wave.

## Enemies

1. **Basic Enemy** – simple, moves directly toward the player.  
2. **Ranged Enemy** – stronger, has more health and attacks from a distance.  
3. **Fast Enemy** – quicker movement, harder to hit.
